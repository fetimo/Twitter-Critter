## About Critter
Critter is Tim Stone's Graduate Project as part of his Interactive Media degree at Bournemouth University. It converts the text in tweets into little 'critters'.

### Aim
Critter's aim is to create a bond with the user, the initial moment between creating a Critter and seeing people's reaction to it is the core purpose for Critter's being.

### Technology

* Back-end built with Ruby (Ramaze as the web framework, Unicorn as the application server)
* Front-end relies on HTML Canvas with EaselJS, Backbone, jQuery
* Custom-built API
* nginx
* RVM for Gem management
* Runs on a VPS from Dreamhost
* Version manged with git (to be open sourced in May)

### Collaborators
Critter would not have been possible without the brilliant Critter designer, Daniel Duke and UI designer Joe Valentine. Also thanks to my seminar group and Mark Shufflebottom for their continual support and ideas.
